    The Task: Build a feed list. Each dictionary should have username, 
    content, likes, and is_verified.

    Loop through and print the content, 
    but add a checkmark (✓) if is_verified is True.

    Use sorted() with a lambda (or a simple loop if they aren't there yet)
    to find the post with the most likes.

    Ask the user for a username, then display all "posts" by that specific user.
